About:
 slapt-update-service is a DBus service which notifies about package updates
 available via slapt-get and gslapt.  slapt-update-service places an icon in
 the user's notification area when updates are available.  Clicking the icon
 starts upgrading with gslapt.

Requirements:
 To build from source, you must have these packages installed:
  autoconf automake libtool m4 gettext gettext-tools pkgconfig
  intltool atk glib2 gtk+2 pango x11 zlib dbus-glib openssl
  curl slapt-get python3

Building:
  Run ./configure.  you must specify the use of one of the following graphical
  su/sudo applications: gnomesu, gksu, kdesu.  For example:
    ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --with-gnomesu=yes
  Now run make.

Installing:
  You can either run 'make install' or 'make pkg'.  The 'pkg' make target
  will create a Slackware package in ./pkg.

Caveats:
  Right now the graphical su/sudo application gnomesu is hardcoded within
  slapt-update-service based on the build time configure option.
